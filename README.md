## USK Guide Code

This is the code that supports the [Arduino Uno Rev 3 Ultimate Starter Kit from Vilros](https://www.vilros.com/ultimate-starter-kit.html), which is a kit that I own.

## Educational electronics kit vendors

There are many companies that provide educational electronics kits, meaning they sell board and components and they also provide tutorials, documentation, and even code libraries to support the electronics they sell. Here are a couple of companies that I have used and recommend.

### Vilros

They sell great starter kits and components for both Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I have both and they are excellent.

### Adafruit

Adafruit has an excellent tutorial library, several regular informative and educational YouTube shows, a blog highlighting cool projects in the world, and a product catalog featuring products they resell as well as products designed in-house by owner and engineer, Limor "Lady Ada" Fried. I have spent a lot of money and time with Adafruit products and their tutorials and they are top notch.

### Parallax

If you are interested in learning robotics, Parallax sells educational robot kits and maintains an excellent tutorial library and curriculum for middle-school age and up robotics learning. I used their Arduino BOE Shield Bot kit and the related online curriculum to teach my 9-year-old niece to build and program her robot. Some of the material was a little over her head, which we glossed over (better for a middle schooler), but she enjoyed it a great deal.
