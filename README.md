## USK Guide Code

This is the code that supports the [Arduino Uno Rev 3 Ultimate Starter Kit from Vilros](https://www.vilros.com/ultimate-starter-kit.html), which is a kit that I own.

## Educational electronics kit vendors

There are many companies that provide educational electronics kits, meaning they sell board and components and they also provide tutorials, documentation, and even code libraries to support the electronics they sell. Here are a couple of companies that I have used and recommend.

### Vilros

They sell great starter kits and components for both Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I have both and they are excellent.

### Adafruit

Adafruit has an excellent tutorial library, several regular informative and educational YouTube shows, a blog highlighting cool projects in the world, and a product catalog featuring products they resell as well as products designed in-house by owner and engineer, Limor "Lady Ada" Fried. I have spent a lot of money and time with Adafruit products and their tutorials and they are top notch.

### Parallax

If you are interested in learning robotics, Parallax sells educational robot kits and maintains an excellent tutorial library and curriculum for middle-school age and up robotics learning. I used their Arduino BOE Shield Bot kit and the related online curriculum to teach my 9-year-old niece to build and program her robot. Some of the material was a little over her head, which we glossed over (better for a middle schooler), but she enjoyed it a great deal.

## Online courses

Coursera - [Create Your Own Internet of Things (IoT) Device specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/iot)

You can enroll in the specialization for a low price or audit each course individually for free. I've taken the following 2 courses so far which was enough to get me up and running and able to become conversant enough in the terms and concepts to search for resources on my own. Highly recommended.

- **Introduction to the Internet of Things and Embedded Systems** â€” This is an excellent introduction to embedded systems. This is a really helpful course that will help you familiarize yourself with common terms and concepts associated with embedded systems and the Internet of Things. It really helped demystify a lot of terms. If you are totally new to Arduino and Raspberry Pi or even just have a vague notion of what they are about, I highly recommend watching the videos in this course.
- **The Arduino Platform and C Programming** - This course will get you up and running with Arduino. (This course is where I learned about the Vilros Arduino kit, which you will need for this course.
